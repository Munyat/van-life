## Overview

The Van Life project aims to connect van owners (hosts) with renters by providing a clean and responsive platform to list, view, and manage van rental options. It includes both a customer-facing interface and a host dashboard to manage listings, income, and reviews.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Built using HTML5, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic User Interface:** Developed with React, featuring reusable components.
- **State Management:** Uses React hooks and custom hooks (e.g., `useVansFetch`) for managing data.
- **Routing:** Implemented with React Router for navigating between pages.
- **Host Dashboard:** Dedicated section for hosts to manage vans, pricing, photos, income, and reviews.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error components to handle not found pages and other issues.
- **Build Tool:** Configured with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Server Integration:** Basic server set-up using `server.js` for backend support (if applicable).
